                <h1>Bleach</h1>
               <p> Ichigo Kurosaki is an ordinary high schooler—until his family is attacked by a Hollow, a corrupt spirit that seeks to devour human souls.
                 It is then that he meets a Soul Reaper named Rukia Kuchiki, who gets injured while protecting Ichigo's family from the assailant. To save his family,
                  Ichigo accepts Rukia's offer of taking her powers and becomes a Soul Reaper as a result. However, as Rukia is unable to regain her powers, Ichigo is given 
                  the daunting task of hunting down the Hollows that plague their town. However, he is not alone in his fight, as he is later joined by his 
                  friends—classmates Orihime Inoue, Yasutora Sado, and Uryuu Ishida—who each have their own unique abilities. As Ichigo and his comrades get used to their
                   new duties and support each other on and off the battlefield, the young Soul Reaper soon learns that the Hollows are not the only real threat to the human
                    world.</p>
               <p class="text-end">I do not know if you graduated from the academy, but we were not taught there to fight for command or for our family. "Shinigami should 
                devote his life to protecting friends and all of humanity." Yes, Kurosaki and I are on the same side of the barricades, but they are his friends. Being true
                shinigami, they can't help but rush to his aid. — Toshiro Hitsugaya Byakue Kuchiki, Chapter 674.</p>
